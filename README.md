## Install

<details>
<summary><b>Arch</b>, CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Manjaro</summary>

```bash
yay -S face-unlock
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Fedora</b></summary>

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL -o /etc/yum.repos.d/face-unlock.repo \
  https://loonixtools.github.io/face-unlock/face-unlock.repo
sudo dnf install face-unlock
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Debian</b>, Ubuntu</summary>

```bash
codename="$(sed -n 's/^VERSION_CODENAME=//p' /etc/os-release)"
sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://loonixtools.github.io/face-unlock/KEY.gpg \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/face-unlock.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/face-unlock.gpg] https://loonixtools.github.io/face-unlock/deb/$codename ./" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/face-unlock.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install face-unlock
```

- **KDE Plasma:** works out of the box.
- **GNOME:** log out and back in once after installing.
- **Hyprland and Niri:** the bubble only shows on face-unlock's own lock screen. If you want to keep your lockscreen it will show a text on the top of the screen. You
  also need a polkit agent. If none runs, the menu offers to install one.

<details>
<summary>Hyprland and Niri: which lock screen?</summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="res/screenshots/lock-choice.png" alt="The window that asks which lock screen to use: face-unlock's with the bubble on the left, the user's own hyprlock with a line of text at the top on the right" width="560">
</p>

When you turn face unlock on, a window asks which lock screen you want. You
can change it later under **Settings**.

- **face-unlock's own:** the bubble, the time and your wallpaper. You lock with
  `face-unlock lock`, and the menu shows where to put that.
- **Yours** (hyprlock, swaylock, gtklock or waylock): press Enter on the empty
  password field to scan. hyprlock and swaylock also scan when you come back.
  There is no bubble, but hyprlock shows a line of text at the top.

Hyprland without uwsm needs a line in its config. The menu shows it.

## How to use

```bash
face-unlock
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="res/screenshots/menu.png" alt="The face-unlock menu in Konsole: face unlock on, one face, lock screen, sudo and admin prompts on" width="560">
</p>

Press **1** and look at the camera. Then lock the screen and look at it.

## Is it safe?

A convenience, not extra security. A webcam only sees a flat picture.

| | |
|---|---|
| Photo or video on a phone, tablet or glossy screen | ✅ Stopped |
| Matte printed photo | ⚠️ Only stopped with photo check *strict* |
| Video of you on a big matte screen | ❌ Can get in |
| Five failed tries | ⏸️ Paused for 15 minutes |
| Your face data | 🔒 Numbers, no pictures. Root only. |
| sudo over SSH | 🚫 Never unlocked by a face |

<details>
<summary>How it works</summary>

| | |
|---|---|
| `face-unlockd` | The root service. Owns the camera and the face data. |
| `face-unlock-agent` | Runs in your session. Watches the lock screen, draws the bubble. |
| `pam_face_unlock.so` | Lets sudo and admin prompts ask the service. |
| `face-unlock` | The menu. |

Two small networks from the OpenCV model zoo run on the CPU: YuNet finds the face, SFace turns it
into numbers. All details: `man face-unlock`.

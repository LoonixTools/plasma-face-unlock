Updates come with your system updates. It needs a camera and one of these
desktops, on Wayland:

| | Lock screen | sudo and admin prompts | Bubble |
|---|---|---|---|
| KDE Plasma 6 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ above the lock screen too |
| GNOME | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ above the lock screen too |
| Hyprland | ✅ hyprlock, swaylock, gtklock, waylock, or face-unlock's own | ✅ | ✅ on face-unlock's own lock screen too, as a line of text in hyprlock |
| Niri | ✅ swaylock, hyprlock, gtklock, waylock, or face-unlock's own | ✅ | ✅ on face-unlock's own lock screen too, as a line of text in hyprlock |

On GNOME a small GNOME extension draws the bubble. Turning face unlock on
switches it on; right after installing, log out and back in once.

On Hyprland and Niri the lock screen is a program of your choice. When you
turn face unlock on, a window shows your screen both ways and asks which you
want: face-unlock's lock screen with your wallpaper, or yours, rebuilt from its
config. You can change it later under **Settings**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="res/screenshots/lock-choice.png" alt="The window that asks which lock screen to use: face-unlock's with the bubble on the left, the user's own hyprlock with a line of text at the top on the right" width="560">
</p>

- **face-unlock's lock screen**, with the bubble, the time and the wallpaper of
  your desktop (from swaybg, awww, hyprpaper or wpaperd). You lock with
  `face-unlock lock`, and the menu shows where to put that. Under **Settings**
  you can pick a picture instead, or a folder to take one from at random,
  blurred if you like.
- **Keep your lock screen.** Only it can open itself, so face-unlock goes into
  its password check, as with sudo: press Enter on the empty password field to
  scan. hyprlock and swaylock also scan by themselves when you come back, and
  so does gtklock after 4.0.0 (the first to open from outside). They cover the
  bubble, but hyprlock shows what face unlock is doing as a line of text at the
  top (face-unlock adds that line to your `hyprlock.conf`), and gtklock shows
  its messages. swaylock and waylock have no way to show them.

Admin prompts and setting up a face need a polkit agent there (for example
hyprpolkitagent). Hyprland without uwsm does not start the part that watches
the lock screen by itself: the menu shows what to add to its config.

<details>
<summary>Hyprland and Niri: face-unlock's lock screen on a key</summary>

`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`, and `lock_cmd` in `hypridle.conf`:

```ini
bind = SUPER, L, exec, face-unlock lock
```

`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` (Hyprland 0.56 and newer):

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + L", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("face-unlock lock"))
```

`~/.config/niri/config.kdl`, and `face-unlock lock` in swayidle:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Alt+L { spawn "face-unlock" "lock"; }
}
```

`face-unlock lock` returns as soon as the screen is locked, so it also works
for locking before sleep.

## How to use

```bash
face-unlock
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="res/screenshots/menu.png" alt="The face-unlock menu in Konsole: face unlock on, one face, lock screen, sudo and admin prompts on" width="560">
</p>

Press **1** and look at the camera. Then lock the screen and look at it.

## Is it safe?

A convenience, not extra security. A webcam only sees a flat picture.

| | |
|---|---|
| Photo or video on a phone, tablet or glossy screen | ✅ Stopped |
| Matte printed photo | ⚠️ Only stopped with photo check *strict* |
| Video of you on a big matte screen | ❌ Can get in |
| Five failed tries | ⏸️ Paused for 15 minutes |
| Your face data | 🔒 Numbers, no pictures. Root only. |
| sudo over SSH | 🚫 Never unlocked by a face |

<summary>How it works</summary>

| | |
|---|---|
| `face-unlockd` | The root service. Owns the camera and the face data. |
| `face-unlock-agent` | Runs in your session. Watches the lock screen, draws the bubble. |
| `pam_face_unlock.so` | Lets sudo and admin prompts ask the service. |
| `face-unlock` | The menu. |

Two small networks from the OpenCV model zoo run on the CPU: YuNet finds the face, SFace turns it
into numbers. All details: `man face-unlock`.
